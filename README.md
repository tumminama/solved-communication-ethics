Write a 4 to 6 page paper on a film or show in which a character has to employ communication ethics. Assess what field of communication the situation addresses (public discourse, interpersonal, organizational, etc.). Please note that more than one field of communication may be used. Explain the situation, how the character(s) handle the situation, and what communication skills and ethics that were or were not present. Do you think he or she used sound ethical communication skills to approach the dilemma, or would you have done something differently? Please remember, this isn’t a discussion on an ethical dilemma alone; you must discuss communication ethics and approaches character(s) use in regards to communication. You may pick a specific scene or overall communication tactic of a character rather than the discuss the whole plot. Concepts from your textbook and Lessons should be used. Don’t be afraid to think outside the box and get creative with this!

Try not to make this overly complicated. As I said, you can pick a scene, moment, or just overall communication tactic of your character(s). For instance, I could write quite a bit on the communication ethics employed between Lumbergh and his staff (especially Peter) in the film <em>Office Space</em>.
